### Hi there 👋🏾, I am Rodgers Ouma!
###### *Software Engineer* || *Data Eng. Enthusiast* || *Outdoor Photography*

I am a full stack dev, primarily working on backend software architecture, design and development. I also moonlight on frontend development, both on mobile and web. I am currently a Software Engineer at [Twiga Foods](https://twiga.com/), working on last mile ecommerce and delivery software that powers thousands of transactions daily.

### 🛠️ My Tools
* Frontend Web: HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JavaScript, Angular, Vue, Typescript
* Frontend Mobile: Dart (Flutter)
* Backend: Python (Django, Nameko, Flask), NodeJS (Meteor), Go (echo, gqlgen)
* Cloud Computing: GCP, AWS, Heroku, Linode, Netlify and a bit of Azure
* Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Serverless (Lambda, Cloud Run), Hosted Apps (Heroku)
* Architecture: Microservices, Monoliths, Distributed
* CI/CD: Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Actions, CircleCI, Docker

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
* A microservice-architecture style service powering an eCommerce platform
* A Fintech service with multiple partner integrations

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
* Golang (Can't seem to have enough of the parallelism vs conccurrency talk)
