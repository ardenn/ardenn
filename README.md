###### *Software Engineer*

I am a full stack dev, primarily working on backend software architecture, design and development. I also moonlight on frontend development, both on mobile and web.

### My Tools

* Backend: Python (Django, Nameko, Flask), NodeJS (Meteor), Docker
* Cloud Computing: GCP, AWS, Heroku, Linode, Netlify and a bit of Azure
* Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Serverless (Lambda, Cloud Run), Hosted Apps (Heroku)
* Architecture: Microservices, Monoliths, Distributed
* CI/CD: Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Actions, CircleCI

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
* A microservice-architecture style service powering an eCommerce platform
* A Fintech service with multiple partner integrations

* Golang (Can't seem to have enough of the parallelism vs conccurrency talk)
